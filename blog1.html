    <p class="intro">We humans are unable to experience the true nature of the universe unfiltered. Our senses and
        brains can only
        process a fraction of the world. So we have to use concepts and tools to learn about the true nature of
        reality. Technological progress not only widened our knowledge about the universe, it also made us aware of
        unsettling possibilities. In the future, it might become possible to simulate entire universes. But if this is
        an option, how can we know that it's not already happened? What if we are not creators, but creations? Is it
        possible that we are not real and we don't even know it?

        If our current understanding of physics is correct,
        then it's impossible to simulate the whole universe with its trillions and trillions of things. But we don't
        actually need to anyway. We only need enough universe to fool the inhabitants of our simuation into thinking
        that they're real. Who needs billions of galaxies? We only need the space our subjects are allowed to explore.
        The vast universe could just be a flat projection, and they would have no way to know. What about small things
        like cells or bacteria? We don't really need them. When you use a microscope, what you see could be instantly
        created. Same with atoms. The chair you're sitting on rigth now does not need to be simulated with quadillions
        of atoms. We just need the outermost layer of it. It might be empty inside until you decide to break it open.
        Your body might feel like it's filled with filled bubbly things, but it might be empty until you open it. The
        minimum requirement for our simulation is only the consciousness of our virtual humans. Our subjects just need
        to think the simulation is real. Okay, so are we being simulated? Well, maybe, but there are a few conditions
        that need to be met.

        Based on a modified version of the original simulation argument by Nick Bostrom. There are
        five assumptions. If they are true, you, dear reader are living in a simulation.
    <ul class="assume">
        <li>
            <h4>Assumption One</h4>
            <p>It's possible
                to simulate consciousness. Nobody knows what consciousness is. For the sake of argument, let's assume
                that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain. Brains are pretty complex. If you count
                every interaction between synapses as one operation, your brains runs at about ten to the power of 17 or
                100 million billion operations per second. Let's generously assume we need ten to the power of 20
                operations to simulate 1 second of human consciousness. But we don't want to simulate just one human. We
                want to simulate all of human history at once so we can skip around. Let's say we want to simulate 200
                billion humans with an average lifespan of
                50 years. One year has 30 million second times 50 years times 200 billion human times ten to the power
                of 20 operations. So we need a computer able to handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations
                per second, more operations than there stars in the observable universe. A computer like this is just
                impossible. Except maybe it isn't.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Assumption Two</h4>
            <p>
                Technological progress will not stop anytime soon. If we assume that
                technological progress continues in a similar fashion as it has so far,then there might be galaxies
                spanning
                civilizations with unlimited computer power at some point. Being on a technology level so advanced that
                we
                could
                barely distinguish them from gods. A computer that can handle a million trillion trillion trillion
                operations is
                serious business. But there are actually concepts for computers which could handle this. The Matrioshka
                brain is
                a theoretical megastructure made up of billions of parts orbiting a star feeding on its radiation. A
                computer of
                this scale would have enough power to simulate many thousands, if not millions, of humanities. At the
                same
                time,
                other technologies, like high end future quantum computers, migth lower the size drastically. So it
                might be
                possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city or even smaller, but only if there's still
                someone
                around to build the computer.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Assumption Three</h4>
            <p>
                Advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves. If there is a
                point at which all civilizations destroy themselves, this whole discussion ends here. Looking into
                space,
                you'd
                expect a universe filled with millions of alien civilisations. But we see nobody. The reason for this
                might
                be
                great filters. Great filters are barriers life has to overcome, like nuclear war, asteroids, climate
                change,
                or
                a black hole generator. If life is inherently self-destructive, then there are no simulations.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Assumption Four</h4>
            <p>
                Super advanced civilisations want to run simulations. When we speak of post-human civilisations, we
                don't
                know
                what we're dealing with. To think we know what being as powerful as gods want is pretty arrogant.
                Imagine
                the
                smartest ant on Earth living next to an amusement park. It's curious about what humans are up to. So you
                try
                to
                explain. Unfortunately, tha ant just doesn't understand the concept of roller coasters and standing in
                lines
                and
                holidays and fun doesn't make sense to an ant living an ant's life. It's the same with us and a
                post-human
                being. Compared to them, we are ants. Running simulations for fun or science might be an absurdly stupid
                idea to
                them. But if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons and assumptions, one to three are
                true,
                too,
                then the chances are not zero that you are living inside a simulation.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Assumption Five</h4>
            <p>
                If there are a lot of
                simulations, you are probably inside a simulation. If there are simulated civilisations, it's likely
                that
                there
                are a lot of them. After all, we assume that most human beings have access to practically unlimited
                computing
                power. So if they run simulations, it would be convenient to run millions or even billions of them. If
                there
                are
                billions of simulated universes, there are probably trillions and trillions of simulated conscious
                beings.
                Which
                would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that will ever have existed are simulated. So
                for
                every consciousbeing made of flesh a billion simulated ones exist. Since we have no way of knowing if we
                are
                simulated or not in this case the chances of you being one of the simulated ones are pretty high.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="last">
        So what you consider reality might not be real at all, you really might be simulated. All of this is based on a
        lot of assumptions that we can't really test right now. So many scientists disagree with this whole thought
        experiment so don't burn your house down to test if there will be glitches if you are simulated not that much
        changes for you. You might be on a small planet speeding through eternal nothingness or a simulation inside a
        computer your existence does not become more or less scary and bizzare. All we can hope to do is try to live
        good lives and have a good time and hope that if we actually are simulations in a supercomputer nobody trips
        over the power cable.
