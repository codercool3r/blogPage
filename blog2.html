    <p class="intro">Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing. In the process of trying to understand it to get better at
        killing it,
        we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day. Large animals seem to be immune to cancer,
        which doesn't make any sense. The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have to understand why, we first
        need
        to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.</p>
    <p class="start">
        <img src="img5.jpg" alt="cancer">
        Our cells are protein robots made out of hundereds of millions of
        parts, guided only by chemical reactions. They create and dismantle structures, sustain a metabolism to gain
        energy or make almost perfect copies of themselves. We call these complex chemical reactions pathways. They are
        biochemical networks upon networks, interwined and stacked on the top of each other. Most of them can barely be
        comprehended by a single human mind. And yet they function perfectly until they don't. With billions of
        trillions of reactions happening in thousands of networks over many years, the question is not if something will
        go wrong, but when.
    </p>
    <p>Tiny mistakes add up until the grandiose machinery gets corrupted. To prevent this from
        getting out of hand, our cells have kill switeches that make them commit suicide. But these kill switches are
        not infallible. If they fail, a cell can turn into a cancer cell. Most of them are slain by the immune system
        very quickly. But this is a numbers game. Given enough time, a cell will accrue enough mistakes, slip by
        unnoticed and begin making more of itself. All animals have to deal with this problem. In general, the cells of
        different animals are the same size. the cells of a mouse aren't smalled than yours. It just has fewer cells in
        total and a shorter lifespan. Fewer cells and a short life means a lower chance of things going wrong or cells
        mutating. Or at least it should mean that humans live about 50 times longer and have 1000 times more cells than
        mice. Yet the rate of cancer is basically the same in humans and in mice. Even weirder blue whales with about
        3000
        times more cells than humans don't seem to get cancer at all, really.
    </p>
    <p>This is Peto's paradox. The baffling
        realization that large animals have much, much less cancer than they should. Scientists thin there are two main
        ways of explaining the paradox. Evolution and hyper tumors. </p>
    <ul class="solution">
        <li>
            <h4>Solution one: Evolution</h4>
            <p class="one">Evolve or become a blob of cancer. As
                multicellular beings developed to 600 million years ago, animals became bigger and bigger, which added
                more and
                more cells and hence more and more chances that cells could be corrupted. So, the collective had to
                invest in
                better and better cancer defenses, the ones that did not die out. But cancer doesn't just happen. It's a
                process
                that involves many individual mistakes and mutations in several specific genes within the same cell.
                These genes
                are called proto-oncogenes. And when they mutate, it's bad news. For example, with the right mutation, a
                cell
                will lose its ability to kill itself. Another mutation, and it will develop the ability to hide,
                another, and it
                will send out calls for resources. Another one and it will multiply quickly. These oncogenes have an
                antagonist, though tumor suppressor genes. They prevent these critical mutations from happening or order
                the
                cell to kill itself. If they decide it's beyond repair. </p>
            <p>It turns out that large animals have an increased number
                of them. Because of this, elephant cells require more mutations than micelles to develop a tumor. They
                are not
                immune, but more resilient. This adaptation probably coes with a cost in some form, but researchers
                still aren't
                sure what it is. Maybe tumor supressors make elephants age quicker later in life or slow down how
                quickly
                injuries heal. We don't know yet, but the solution to the paradox may actually be something different.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Solution two: Hypertumors</h4>
            <p class="one">Hypertumors are named after hyper-parasites, the parasites of parasites. Hyper tumors are
                the tumors of tumors. Cancer can be thought of as a breakdown in cooperation. Normally, cells work
                together to
                form structures like organs, tissue, or elements of the immune system. But cancer cells are selfish and
                only
                work for their own short term benefit. If they are successful, they form tumors huge cancer collectives
                that can
                be very hard to kill. Making a tumor is hard work though. Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply
                rapidly,
                which requires a lot of resources and energy. The amount of nutrients they conceal from the body becomes
                the
                limiting factor for growth. So the tumor cells trick the body to build new blood vessels directly to the
                tumor
                to feed the thing, killing it.</p>
            <p>This process can repeat over and over, and this may prevent
                cancer from becoming a problem for a large organism. It is possible that large animals have more of
                these hyper
                tumors than we realize. They might just not become big enough to notice. Which makes sense. A two gram
                tumor is
                10% of a mouse's body weight, while it's less than 0.002% of a human and 0.000002% of a blue whale. All
                three
                tumors require the same number of cell divisons and have the same number of cells. So an old blue whale
                might be
                filled with tiny cancers and just not care.</p>
            <p></p>

        There are other propsed solutions to the Peto's paradox such as different
        metabolic rates or different cellular architecture but right now we just don't know. Scientists are working on
        the problem. Figuring out how large animals are resilient to one of the most deadly diseases we know could open
        the path to new therapies and treatments. Cancer has always been a challenge. Today we are finally beginning to
        understand it and by doing so, one day we might finally overcome it.
